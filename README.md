# Tabard

I was definitely not under any influence when I wrote this. At _all_.

Not-even-beta status. But it works.

## Usage

Write blog posts in the `app/storage/content` folder. Name the files like `1-hello-world`, `2-bananas`, `4-watermelons` - the number at the beginning needs to be sequential, but you can skip numbers. Unix timestamps are fine. Posts will be ordered in that order.

Files contain a YAML metadata section up top, then markdown:

```
title: Post Title
---

# Hello World

Normal *markdown* goes here.

```

Edit the `BlogController` and `blog.blade.php` file to fit.

Files should be regenerated by cron, updated periodically, by visiting a hidden link, or just regenerate all the time because your servers can take it, yo.
